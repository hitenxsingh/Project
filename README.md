## Overview

The RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) Dashboard is a web application that allows you to manage users, roles, 
and permissions within an organization. It provides an intuitive interface for administrators to manage user accounts, 
assign roles, and define permissions. The app is built using **ReactJS** with **Vite**, styled with **TailwindCSS**, 
and powered by **TypeScript** for type safety. **GSAP** animations are added for a smoother and more interactive user experience.

### Features:

2. **Role Management:**
    - Define and edit roles.
    - Roles can have associated permissions (e.g., Read, Write, Delete) or custom attributes.
